# trace: a distribution ray tracer

This ray tracer supports distributed rays for realistic graphical effects: soft shadows, glossy reflections, translucent material, and depth of field. It also progressively renders images to give an impression of their final appearance as early as possible.

* `doc`: A presentation and description of the `trace` program.
* `images`: Samples of rendered images.
* `scenes`: Data files that define scenes to be rendered.
